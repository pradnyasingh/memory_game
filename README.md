# memory_game
•In this project of memory test game i have used two libraries ==>pillow and tkinter for designing the framework of game.

•Tkinter relies on Pillow for working with images. Pillow is a fork of the Python Imaging Library, and can be imported in a Python console as PIL.

•PIL==>Python Imaging Library is a free and open-source additional library for the Python programming language that adds support for 
opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.

•Modules used in this project are random and os also the OOps concept.

•The project is about memorising the location of characters so that we can know how strong the photographic memory of an indiviual is.

♦How to play the game?

1.Firstly run the code

2.Now a window appears on screen,if we randomly click on any button the pop up box will direct us to how to start playing the game
by displaying the msg===>•lets start the game first ===>click on SHOW CHARACTERS

3.after following the steps of starting the game if we are still clueless that how to proceed ahead coz of which if we randomly click on any button
it will direct what should be the next step===>•click on HIDE CHARACTERS

4.Now the images would be invisible and you have to check the shown image where it was when you clicked on show characters.

5.if its correct it will display msg as===>•Hurray! its a correct choice and if its not ====>•Oops! incorrect choice.
